# 👋 Hi, I'm Ignacio!

🎓 **Double Major Student in Mathematics & Computer Engineering**

I'm passionate about the intersection of math, technology, and innovation. As a double major, I dive deep into both theoretical foundations and practical applications, exploring new frontiers in software development, data science, and artificial intelligence.

### Trajectory 💼

💻 During **Summer 2025**, I worked as a **Web Development Intern at Grupo Hotusa**, contributing to the development of web-based solutions.  
🧠 During **Summer 2024**, I worked as a **Machine Learning Intern at IDIS (Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria de Santiago de Compostela)**, applying ML techniques to real-world research problems.  
I am currently pursuing a **Double Degree in Computer Engineering and Mathematics** at the  
👉 **[University of Santiago de Compostela (USC)](https://www.usc.gal/en/studies/degrees/engineering-and-architecture/double-degree-informatics-engineering-and-mathematics-2nd-edition)**  
🚀 I have collaborated in **multiple hackathons**, gaining experience in teamwork, rapid prototyping, and problem-solving under time constraints.
